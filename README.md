# Bank of England Project

**Background/context of the business:**

The Bank of England (BoE) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) face a significant challenge overseeing 1,500 financial institutions effectively. While numerical indicators are well established for risk monitoring, there is a crucial gap in leveraging qualitative data.
Quarterly earnings calls with CEOs and analysts provide a rich, untapped source of data extending beyond traditional financial metrics, offering insights into potential risks through linguistic patterns, sentiment analysis, and topic modelling to uncover underlying themes and behavioural cues.
This project aims to improve the Bank of England's risk assessments of firms by applying advanced language models to analyse quarterly results transcripts, scale qualitative analysis, convert that into a quantitative metric (Financial stability and risk score - FSRS) that detects early signs of distress in a bank and is likely to collapse. Uncovering these insights can help understand a firm's stability and risk profile before they appear in traditional financial metrics. 
This project has the potential to significantly enhance the PRA’s ability to proactively assess firms, enable efficient resource prioritisation and improve oversight of firms engaging in high-risk behaviour thereby helping prevent future financial crises’.

**Objective:**

To improve the Bank of England's risk assessments of firms by applying advanced language models to analyse quarterly results transcripts. 
If we analyse quarterly earnings call transcripts then we can identify signs of distress in a bank including early warning indicators that a bank is likely to collapse, uncovering insights that help understand a firm's stability and risk profile


**Project Description:**

Developed a framework to analyse quarterly earnings calls and to enhance understanding of financial stability and risks of firms using agile methodology. Categorised banks as ‘Distressed,’ ‘Stable,’ or ‘Volatile’ to explore risk signals and track shifts from stability to distress and recovery. Developed a RAG pipeline leveraging LLMs for summarization, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Designed workflows for data preprocessing, linguistic analysis, and Q&A systems using prompt engineering. Incorporated visualisations and time-series modeling to analyse sentiment trends. Delivered insights to integrate qualitative metrics into banking risk models for early warning systems.
